# ML-Models

## INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the ML Models repository! This repository contains various machine learning models that I have created. Each model is stored as a Colab Notebook (.ipynb) in the ml_models folder, and the supporting data used to create the models is stored in the data folder. As of now, the repository consists of the following machine learning models:

### Rock vs Mine Prediction using Logistic Regression

- Model: Logistic Regression
- Dataset: sonar.csv
- Notebook: rock_vs_mine_prediction_model.ipynb

### Heart Disease Prediction Model using Logistic Regression

- Model: Logistic Regression
- Dataset: heart.csv
- Notebook: Heart_Disease_Prediction_Model.ipynb

### Diabetes Prediction Model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier

- Model: Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
- Dataset: diabetes.csv
- Notebook: Diabetes_Prediction_Model.ipynb

## DIRECTORIES

- Explore the data folder to access the datasets used for each model.
- Open the ml_models folder to view the Jupyter Notebooks containing the model implementations and training process.
- Execute the Colab Notebooks to re-run the models or to build upon them for your specific use case.

  ## CONTRIBUTING

I welcome contributions to this repository! If you have any suggestions, bug fixes, or would like to add your own machine learning models to the collection, feel free to submit a pull request.

Happy machine learning!
